# SP500 data science project

This is a Data science project made using sp500 data, taken from an API from YFinance!, using webscraping to update the index before calling the tickers. It was made during soyHenry data science bootcamp.

It is entirely written in Python, using Pandas, Seaborn and Plotly. There are two versions, the notebook with visualization outputs and the .py file.
